# Question 1: palindrome1 is a string operation function that checks if a string is a palindrome.
#            palindrome2 is a loop operation function that checks if a string is a palindome.

# Question 2: Stacks and queues!
# Create a stack and queue and the associated functions for said data structures:
# push(s,x) — push x to stack s, return the modified stack
# pop(s) — pop an item off stack s, return the item
# enqueue(q,x) — add x to the tail of queue q, return the modified queue
# dequeue(q) — remove an item from the head of queue q, return the item

# Write two versions of a factorial function: 
# fac1(n) – implement with recursion
# fac2(n) – implement with a loop
