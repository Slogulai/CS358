Q1.) Write a regular expression that will match entire lines (Strings without and embedded newline) that:

    a.) Start and end with top
    b.) Contain both top and pot (in either order)
    c.) Does not contain tt 

    The expression I was able to create was: 
                ^(t?[^t])*t?$
    This expression was able to match the entire line for the expression ((a(b*)c)|(de))

Q2.) 
    Give a regular expression for hexadeximal constants:
        
        0x[0-9a-f]+

    Give three regular expressions for the set of even-valued integer constants

    a.) Decimal even valued integer constants:
        0|([1-9][0-9]*[02468])
    b.) Octal even valued integer constants:
        0[0-7]*[02468]
    c.) Hexadecimal even valued integer constants:
        0x[0-9a-f]*[02468ace]

Q3.) Consider the following CFG
        E -> E + E | x
    where + and x are terminals

    a.) Describe the language defined by this grammar
        The language defined by this grammer includes the single terminal x and any number of x's
        combined with the + operator. 
    
    b.) Show that this grammer is ambiguous by finding a sentence that has two dinstinct parse trees.

        Consider the expression x + x + x

        Tree 1:             Tree 2:
            E                   E
           /|\                 /|\
          E + E               E + E
         /|\   \             /   /|\
        E + E   x           x   E + E
       /     \                 /     \
      x       x               x       x

      Tree 1 is a left associative parse of the expression while Tree 2 is a right
      associative parse of the expression. This shows that the grammer is ambiguous.

    c.) Find an unambiguous grammer that defines the same language

            E-> E + T | T
            T-> x

        The above grammar is unambiguous because the + operator is left associative, removing the ambiguouity

    d.) It turns out the language defined by this grammar is regular. Find a regular expression for it.

        x(\+x)*

        This regular expression will match one or more x symbols with the + operator.
    

Q4.) Consider one of the ambiguity grammar examples from this week’s lecture:
        
        S -> if e then S else S | if e then S | other
    
    For the purposes of this exercise, we use terminal symbols e and other as placeholders for expressions and
    (other forms of) statement, respectively; in a real language, these would actually be defined by nonterminals.
    Show that this grammar is ambiguous by finding a string that has two different parse trees. Write down
    left-most deriviations and/or draw the parse trees.
    
    Consider the expression:
        if e then if e then S else S 
    There are two possible parse trees for this expression since the else can be associated with the inner or outer
    if statement. 

        Tree 1                                   Tree 2
             S                                     S 
          / / \ \                              / / |    \  \  \ 
         if e then S                          if e then S else S
               / / | \ \ \                           / /| \
             if e then S else S                    if e then S
    
    The implied interpretations are:
        Tree 1: if e then (if e then S) else S
        Tree 2: if e then (if e then S else S)

Q5.) Consider the set of perfectly nested parentheses: {(), (()), ((())), ...}.
    (a) Provide a context-free grammar for this set.
    (b) Now consider the set of perfectly nested parentheses and brackets: {(), [], [[]], ([]), [(())],
    ...}. Provide a context-free grammar for it.
